<h2 class="p4">A-B-C OF VEGETABLE GARDENING</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">FOREWORD</p>

<p class="pn p2">Not everybody has a garden. Some deny
themselves the pleasure and the profit of
one because they have never had any experience
in gardening, and have somehow
got the impression that special training is
necessary to make a success of the undertaking.
Here is where they make a mistake.
There is no special "knack" about it. Any
one who owns a bit of land, and has some time
that can be given to garden-work, and an inclination
to do so, can make a gardener of
himself in a season&mdash;and a successful one,
too&mdash;if he allows himself to be governed by
the advice of some one who has had some experience
along this line. After the first season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
he will not be likely to ask or need advice,
for the practical knowledge which comes with
one season's work among vegetables will not
only be sufficient to enable him to go on with
his gardening operations on his own responsibility,
but it will have made him so enthusiastic
over them that he will be eager to
enlarge his knowledge of "the green things
growing," and in doing this he will find a
pleasure that will make him wonder how he
ever came to consider gardening something
to dread.</p>

<p>Others, who have but a small piece of land,
may think it not worth while to attempt to
grow vegetables on it. They labor under the
impression that a garden, in order to prove
a success, requires more land than is at their
disposal. Here is where <i>they</i> make a mistake.
Of course one cannot grow a large quantity
of vegetables on a small piece of ground, but
the one who undertakes to make the most of
a small piece will be surprised at the amount
that can be grown on it. In a garden that
is not more than twenty-five feet square a
friend of mine grows all the summer vegetables
required by his family of four persons.
This calls for what the scientific people call
"intensive gardening," and makes it necessary
to plant and plan for a succession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
vegetables; but that twenty-five feet square
of ground enables him to get a good share of
the summer living of his family.</p>

<p>Another notion is, that in order to have a
good garden a large amount of time and labor
must be expended on it. Not so. A very
small amount of systematized labor will be
demanded by even a good-sized garden, if it
is planned in such a manner that labor-saving
tools can be used in its cultivation. If
we look back to the gardening days of fifty
or even twenty-five years ago, when everything
was done at the hardest and the hand
had to do a good share of the work that we
now do with helpful implements, it is not to be
wondered at that the old-time care of a garden
discourages many from undertaking to have
one. Happily those days are over, and with
the gardening facilities of the present it is
an easy matter to accomplish more in an
hour than could be done then in a day. There
is really no drudgery in gardening as it is
done to-day. On the contrary, there is positive
pleasure in the operation of the machinery
which inventive genius has furnished
for the up-to-date gardener's use.</p>

<p>Those who have never had a garden of their
own, but have bought vegetables in the ordinary
market, are not in a position to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the wide difference between the
article we buy and the one which is taken
directly from the ground and eaten at once.
While it is possible to keep most vegetables
looking fresh for a considerable time by the
use of water and ice, it is not possible to
make them retain that delicacy of flavor
known only to those whose vegetables go
straight from the garden to the kitchen. If
you want any vegetable <i>at its best</i> you must
grow it in your own garden.</p>

<p>The general impression seems to be that
gardening is essentially man's work, and that
women and children are not equal to it. This
is another mistake that will rapidly be done
away with, for the woman of to-day is no
longer a housed-up woman. She is rapidly
learning the value of fresh air, and the tonic
of outdoor life is fast taking the place of the
doctor's prescriptions. The writer knows of
many women who have found work in the
garden not only a healthful occupation, but
one so delightful that they look forward to
spring with most pleasurable anticipations,
and long for the time to come when they can
get to work out of doors. When we have
tried both we learn that work in the vegetable-garden
is no harder than that in the
flower-garden, and that neither demands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
more strength or time than the average
woman is able to give it if she makes use
of labor-saving tools. What is true of the
woman is equally true of the children. A
child ten years of age can do a good deal of
the work that a good-sized garden calls for.</p>

<p>I would not be understood as advocating
the giving up of garden-work to women and
children. I would not deny man the pleasure
of sharing in it. But I would urge the importance
of interesting women and children
in it, and of encouraging them to take part
in it from the viewpoint of health. Benefit
in other respects will become so apparent,
after a little, that further encouragement will
not be necessary. Most women who have
some leisure&mdash;especially if they are of the
housewife class&mdash;will be so pleased with the
results of gardening that they will be glad
to supplement the labors of the man of the
family by what they can accomplish in it, if
he is employed in work that will not allow
him to devote much time to the garden. And
they will find that the boys of the family&mdash;and
the girls as well&mdash;can be made to take
an active part in the good work with but
little encouragement from their elders. It
is natural for both boys and girls to dig in the
soil, and it is well to encourage them to dig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to some purpose. It is natural work, and
healthy work, and work that will do more to
keep the average child out of mischief than
any other influence that can be brought to
bear on it. But I would not allow the child
to get the impression that I gave it garden-work
to do as a mischief-preventative. That
would spoil everything. Aim to interest the
boys and girls in the mysterious processes of
nature. Encourage them to plan and execute
as much of the work as can safely be
trusted to them. In a short time you will
find that most of them are equal to all the
requirements of the ordinary garden.</p>

<p>I have often been told by those who have
had years of experience in garden-work that
at least half one's living for half the year
can be obtained from the garden, even if it
happens to be a small one, and my own experience
bears out the truth of this statement.
If we grow our own vegetables we
are quite sure to have a greater variety to
add to the daily bill of fare than would be
the case if we were to buy them. We have
them when we want them without making
a trip to the market for them, or depending
on the uncertainties of telephone orders
which grocers so frequently fill by sending
vegetables of a quality that would not satisfy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
us if we gave them personal inspection before
purchasing. The entire family will be
delighted with the frequent changes that can
be made in the bill of fare, and no one more
so than the housewife who often finds it a
difficult matter to plan for a variety of food
when the family income does not warrant
a liberal outlay.</p>

<p>No owner of a bit of ground that can be
made into a garden can afford to let it remain
unused. If he does so he does it in disregard
of the economy which most of us are
obliged to consider and practise in these
days of high prices and the increasing cost
of daily living.</p>

<p>Have a garden if you can.</p>

<p class="pn center mid">GETTING THE GARDEN READY</p>

<p class="pn p2">The amateur gardener will almost invariably
be in too great a hurry to begin
gardening operations in the spring. But a
few warm days are not sufficient to put the
ground in proper condition for seeding, or
even for plowing and spading. The frost
must be allowed to get out of it, and after
that an opportunity must be given for surplus
water from melting snows and spring
rains to drain away before work can be done
to any advantage. As a general thing not
much can be done in gardening at the North
before the first of May. It is an old saying
that "haste makes waste," and the gardener
who is in too great a hurry often learns the
truth which underlies the saying by the
failure to germinate of the seed he puts into
the ground very early in the season.</p>

<p>Another old saying that should be kept in
mind is that "one swallow does not make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
summer." Read "warm day" for "swallow"
and you will get the force of the statement.
It is not advisable to do much at gardening
until you are reasonably sure that warm
weather has come to stay. Even if early-planted
seed comes up, spells of cold weather,
and often of frost, which we are likely to
have at the North until about the first of
May, will have such a debilitating effect on
comparatively hardy plants that those grown
from later sowings, when all conditions are
favorable, will come to maturity ahead of
them. Therefore it will be seen that it is
poor policy to be in too great a hurry, and
good policy to wait for what the farmer
calls "growing weather" before doing much
work in the garden.</p>

<p>If very early vegetables are wanted it will
be necessary to start them in the hotbed.
In another chapter I will give some directions
for the making and management of
this very important adjunct of gardening.</p>

<p>The first thing to do in making a garden
is to plow or spade it. Plowing is not admissible
on small grounds, but where there
is room enough to allow a team and plow to
operate I would advise it in preference to
spading, because it will save a good deal of
hard work, and greatly expedite matters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Before plowing some system of manuring
should be decided on, as whatever fertilizer
is used should be worked well into the soil,
and this the plow can do most effectively.
Barn-yard manure, if old and well rotted, is
better than anything else I have any knowledge
of for all kinds of vegetables, but unfortunately
it is seldom obtainable by those
who do not live in the country. There are
many commercial fertilizers on the market,
but not all kinds of them are adapted to all
kinds of soil. In order to secure the best
results it is advisable that the amateur gardener
should consult some dealer in these
fertilizers in his immediate vicinity, or some
one who has had personal experience in their
use, with a view to making sure that he is
getting just the kind best adapted to the soil
in his garden. It is absolutely necessary that
he should do this, in fact, for if he buys at
random he runs the risk of getting something
that will fail to answer his purpose.</p>

<p>While it is always advisable to apply
whatever fertilizer is used before plowing,
commercial fertilizers can be applied later
with good effect; but it will be necessary to
apply them in such a manner that they do
not come directly into contact with the seed,
as many of them are so strong that they kill it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Plow the garden deeply, for by so doing
you bring to the surface a stratum of soil
in which there is more latent fertility than
in that close to the surface.</p>

<p>After plowing, allow the soil to remain as
thrown up from the furrow for two or three
days. Sunshine and warm air will have a
disintegrating effect on it, which will make it
easy for you to reduce it under the application
of hoe and iron rake to that mellow condition
so necessary to the welfare of the
plants you propose to grow. It should be
worked over and over until not a lump is
left in it. You cannot expect to grow good
vegetables in a soil that has not been well
pulverized before seed is planted. Large
grounds, or those of a size that admit of the
use of horses, can be speedily mellowed with
the harrow, which should be run over the
ground from all directions until it is thoroughly
pulverized. In the small garden the rake and
hoe will have to take the place of the harrow.</p>

<p>Small pieces of ground should be spaded.
Let the soil remain as thrown up by the spade
for two or three days before attempting to
work it.</p>

<p>I have been told by some amateur gardeners
that they did not use much manure because
trees and shrubs that grew in close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
proximity to their gardens were so thrifty
without manuring that they felt confident
that the soil must be quite rich enough for
vegetables without resorting to the use of
any fertilizer. These persons lacked the experience
which would have enabled them to
understand the wide difference between tree
and vegetable growth. A tree or a bush
sends its roots deeply and widely into the
soil, and applies to its uses food that the
vegetable cannot send its roots in search of.
The roots of most garden plants do not extend
far in any direction, nor go very deep;
therefore food must be given directly to them
if we would secure the best possible result.
There are very few gardens in which the
natural soil has a sufficient amount of nutriment
to produce the effect we aim at without
the addition of some kind of plant-food.</p>

<p>A rich soil is absolutely necessary in order
to hasten development. Unless a vegetable
makes a quick growth it is pretty sure to be
lacking in tenderness and flavor. Of course
it is possible to apply a greater amount than
a plant can make use of, thus forcing an unhealthy
growth, but this is not likely to happen
if we consult the wise old gardener who
knows his garden and the plants he grows in
it as a mechanic knows the machine he uses.</p>

<p class="pn center mid">LAYING OUT THE GARDEN</p>

<p class="pn p2">There will be little "laying out" to do
in the small garden. Here the chief aim
will be to make use of every available bit of
soil; the beds will be narrow, and the paths
between them will be just wide enough to
walk in, and these will be the only portions
of the ground in which something is not
grown. Not much chance for planning, you
see.</p>

<p>In the larger garden it will be not only
possible, but advisable, to do considerable
planning.</p>

<p>If a garden-cultivator is used&mdash;and this
should be done whenever possible&mdash;plan for
rows that will enable you to run it the entire
length of the garden without turning.
Beds are no longer in favor with gardeners
who aim to reduce the work to be done to the
minimum, for in them the cultivator cannot
be used to advantage, and weeding cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
be done with the facility which characterizes
row-planting, nor can the hoe be used as effectively.
There is really no argument that
can be advanced in favor of the old bedding
system for gardens in which we propose to
use labor-saving implements.</p>

<p>If possible, have the rows run north and
south. This enables the sun to get at the
ground lengthwise of the rows, and between
them, which it could not do if they ran east
and west, as the plants in them would shade
all the ground except that in the first and
most southerly row. It is not enough that
the sun should get at the tops of the plants.
The soil needs its vivifying effect.</p>

<p>Plant with regard to the height and habit
of the vegetables you propose to grow. Give
corn a place at the side of the garden. Then
peas which grow tall enough to require bushing,
and then beans, working down through
potatoes, tomatoes, and beets and other low-growing
kinds to onions, radishes, and cucumbers.</p>

<p>If the garden-cultivator is to be used,
leave a space about eighteen inches wide
between the rows to work in. This implement
can be adjusted to fit any width desired.
Its teeth can be set to throw the soil
toward a plant or away from it. It can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
made to do deep or shallow work, as the case
may require. As a general thing, after a
plant has attained some size we throw the soil
toward it. If the teeth are set to do this we
go down one side of the row and back on
the other, thus throwing the soil about the
plant alike on both sides.</p>

<p>It will probably be necessary to remove
some weeds <i>in the row</i>, which cannot be
reached by the cultivator. This can be done
most effectively by the use of a hoe which
is triangular in shape, with the handle-socket
in the center of it. One side is a blade like
the ordinary hoe. The other comes to a sharp
point, with which it is possible to work close
to a plant without running any risk of injuring
it&mdash;something that cannot be done
with the ordinary wide-bladed hoe. Weeds
that grow up side by side with vegetable
seedlings can be picked away from them so
easily, and without disturbing them in the
least, that no hand-pulling will have to be
resorted to in cleaning the rows.</p>

<p>Where the garden-cultivator is used there
will be very little work to do with the hoe,
as this implement stirs the soil and uproots
weeds at the same time. But in the small
garden either hoe or weeding-hook will come
into daily use. The weeding-hook is a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
important tool, though its cost is but ten or
fifteen cents. It enables one to do a good
deal of weeding in a short time, does its work
well, and does away entirely with hand-pulling,
which has heretofore been one of
the chief arguments that men have advanced
against gardening.</p>

<h2 class="p4">III</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">PLANTING THE GARDEN</p>

<p class="pn p2">Most persons make the serious mistake
of covering garden seed too deeply.
Very small seed needs hardly any covering.
Indeed, it does its best, as a general thing,
when simply scattered on the surface and
pressed down into the soil by a smooth board.
This embeds the seed in the soil, which is
made firm enough under the pressure of
the board to retain a sufficient amount
of moisture to assist germination. Very
fine seed often fails to sprout if covered too
deeply.</p>

<p>But most of the seed of garden vegetables
is not fine enough to admit of this method of
planting. If a seed-sower is not used, little
furrows should be made by drawing a stick
through the soil, into which the seed should
be dropped as evenly as possible. It should
then be covered lightly and the soil should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
be pressed down with the hoe to make it
comparatively firm. The probabilities are
that many more plants will come up than it
is advisable to let grow. These surplus seedlings
should be removed from the rows as
soon as the plants get a good start.</p>

<p>Nearly all gardeners make use of the seed-sower.
This is an implement that can be
adjusted to sow all kinds of seed more evenly
than it can be sown by hand, and it can be
sown thickly or thinly, as desired, and at
any required depth. It cannot be used to
much advantage in the very small garden,
where only a small quantity of each kind of
seed will be made use of, but in large gardens
it will be found as much a labor-saver as the
garden-cultivator.</p>

<p>It is always advisable to plant for a
succession if the garden is large enough
to admit of it. By planting at intervals
of ten days or two weeks it is possible to
have fresh vegetables throughout almost
the entire season. Where this is done it
will not be advisable to plant very much of
any one kind.</p>

<p>Among almost all vegetables there are
early, medium, and late varieties. Some of
each of these should be planted in all gardens
of a size to warrant so doing. In the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
garden I would advise the choice of the later
varieties, as these are almost without exception
superior in flavor to the earlier kinds,
which are grown more on account of earliness
than quality.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">IV</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">SEEDS THAT GIVE BEST RESULTS</p>

<p class="pn p2">It is very important that seed of only the
best kind should be used, if we would
grow vegetables of superior quality. Every
gardener of experience will indorse the truth
of this statement.</p>

<p>Said one amateur gardener to me when I
gave him this advice: "Why should one be
so particular about the seed? It's the culture
that you give the plant that counts. Plant
any kind of seed that happens to be handiest
and take good care of the plants that grow
from it and you'll have good vegetables."
To some extent what he said was true, but
he had yet to learn that there is a vast difference
between ordinary seed and seed that
has bred into it by careful culture the superior
qualities which characterize the choicest
varieties of all our garden plants. There
is such a thing as aristocracy of seed, and no
seed that is lacking in this feature can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
expected to afford the satisfaction that results
from the use of the best. No amount
of culture can make a superior vegetable
from plants grown from inferior seed. Bear
this in mind, and buy only the best seed on
the market, be your garden large or small.
The smaller it is, the greater the importance
of using only the best.</p>

<p>"But how are we who know very little
about such things to know which <i>is</i> the best?"
some one may ask.</p>

<p>The only answer I can make to this question
is this: We have in this country many
seed firms that have been in existence for
years&mdash;some of them over half a century&mdash;and
these have built up for themselves a
reputation for handling only seed of the very
best varieties of garden vegetables that it
is possible to grow. Inferior sorts have been
discarded from time to time as those of superior
merit have been produced. These
firms, proud and jealous of the reputation
they have gained, cannot afford to deal in
anything that is not up to their standard
of "the best." From these dealers you can
be sure of getting seed that can always be
depended on to give the highest degree of
satisfaction. The seed they sell you may
cost a little more than some of the newer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
dealers ask for theirs, but the certainty of
getting <i>what you want</i> makes it well worth
while to invest some extra money in it.
Cheap seed&mdash;that which is advertised as
being "just as good as higher-priced seed for
a much smaller amount of money"&mdash;is likely
to prove as cheap in quality as in price.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">V</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">EARLY GARDEN WORK</p>

<p class="pn p2">After planting the garden there will be
a little interval of leisure while the seed
that has been put into the ground is germinating.</p>

<p>Then will come the time of early warfare
with the weeds. Here is where the weeding-hook
of which I have spoken will come into
play in the small garden. This little implement
is in the form of a claw, with five or
six fingers, each about an inch long, and
shaped so that they reach into the ground
and take a firm hold of whatever plants they
are placed over. It can be so operated that
these fingers, working close to plants which
it is not desired to uproot, will tear away the
weeds without disturbing the other plants,
and the soil will be left in light and mellow
condition, as if a tiny rake had been drawn
through it. With this tool the work can be
done with great rapidity. No owner of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
garden, large or small, can afford to be
without it.</p>

<p>It should be used to supplement the work
of the cultivator, which can be depended upon
to take care of all the weeds between the
rows, but which cannot be worked among
the plants <i>in the row</i>.</p>

<p>Weeding should be begun as soon as the
plants are of a size that makes it possible
to tell which is seedling and which is weed.
By beginning the work of clearing the garden
at this period, and doing it thoroughly, and
continuing it at intervals thereafter, it will
be a comparatively easy matter to keep
weeds under control. But if they are allowed
to get a strong start&mdash;as they will in
an incredibly short time if let alone&mdash;it will
be a difficult matter to subdue them and
keep the upper hand during the rest of the
season. It is very important that they
should be given to understand, at the outset,
that they will not be tolerated in your garden.
This will necessitate early work and
careful and regular attention thereafter, but
it will not be the laborious work that so
many persons think it is if it is begun at
the right season and always carried on on
the offensive. It is when weeds have been
allowed to intrench themselves firmly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the garden that this work becomes disagreeable.</p>

<p>Nor is it work that will require a good deal
of one's time. In the cultivation of a garden
it is the little attentions, given when needed,
that count, rather than the amount of labor
and time expended there, as you will find
when you come to have a garden of your own.</p>

<p>If there are any vacant places in the beds
or rows, fill with plants taken from places
where they stand too thick. In the small
garden there should be not one vacant spot.
Every bit of soil should be made to do its
share of work in the production of some
vegetable.</p>

<p>If weeds are kept down during the early
part of the season there ought not to be
many during the latter part of it. But there
will be no time when there will not be <i>some</i>
to wage warfare against, and every gardener
should make it a rule to destroy every one
that gets a start as soon as discovered, for,
by preventing it from developing seed, we
can save ourselves a good deal of work next
season. One weed will bear seed enough to
fill the whole garden with its progeny if
allowed to do so.</p>

<p>If the soil was properly fertilized at planting-time
it will not be necessary to apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
more fertilizer, if any, until the latter part
of the season, and then only a small amount
will be required&mdash;just enough to enable the
soil to do its share in ripening off the plants
that are growing in it. But if, at any time,
the plants seem to lag or come to a standstill
enough should be given to stimulate
active growth.</p>

<p>Careful watch should be kept of everything
in the garden, and prompt advantage
should be taken of any tendency toward
slow development by making fresh applications
of whatever fertilizer was used at the
beginning of the season. In order to attain
the success that the gardener aims at in
the cultivation of vegetables it is absolutely
necessary to keep them going steadily ahead
from start to finish, and this can only be
done by supplying them with a generous
amount of plant-food. There should be no
alternations of liberal feeding and lack of
feeding.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">VI</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">VEGETABLE PLANTS IN THE HOUSE</p>

<p class="pn p2">Many persons would like to grow early
vegetables. With a view to "getting
the start of the season" and, incidentally, of
their neighbors, they sow seed in pots and
boxes in March and April and attempt to get
an "early start" for plants that will form a
basis of supply for family use while they are
waiting for the development of the general
crop from seed sown in the garden after the
weather has become sufficiently warm to
warrant outdoor gardening. In some instances
comparative success has resulted
from plants started into growth in the house,
but nine times out of ten, it is safe to say,
the result has been entire failure. The seedlings
grow fairly well at first, but soon become
weak and die. If, by chance, a few
survive until conditions warrant putting
them in the ground, they are so lacking in
vitality that the change from indoors to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
outdoors is pretty sure to be the end of
them.</p>

<p>I would never advise trying to grow plants
from seed, in the house, unless the grower
understands beforehand the drawbacks to
plant-growth which prevail in the average
dwelling, and is willing to do all he can to
overcome them. Simply filling boxes or
pots with earth, putting seed into them,
and supplying water will not insure success.</p>

<p>One of the unfavorable conditions which
seedling plants must struggle against is too
much heat, if they are kept in the living-room.
An undue amount of warmth forces
them into abnormal development in the
early stages of their growth, and a little
later on there comes a reaction from the
weakness thus brought about, and this reaction
is almost invariably death to the tender
plant.</p>

<p>Another unfavorable condition is the result
of indiscriminate watering. The soil
is either kept too wet or too dry. To grow
good plants there must be an even supply
of moisture.</p>

<p>A third unfortunate condition is the result
of failure to give the plants a liberal supply
of fresh air.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, to overcome these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
conditions and grow really good plants from
seed in the living-room, but it cannot be
done unless the amateur gardener is sufficiently
interested in the undertaking to give
his plants all the attention they need.</p>

<p>Instead of keeping them in the living-room&mdash;which
in most instances will have a
temperature of 79 or 80°&mdash;I would advise
giving them place in a room opening off the
sitting-room, where the temperature can be
so regulated that it will not go above 65°
at any time. There is far less danger of
plants suffering from a low temperature
than of their being injured by an excess of
heat. If the room in which they are kept
has snug windows, in most instances it will
get all the warmth that is needed by leaving
open at night the door which connects it
with the living-room. If the weather is
very cold, the plants can be removed, temporarily,
to the living-room, or they can be
covered with newspapers. Thick paper
shades at the windows will do much to keep
out cold and prevent draughts. Storm-sash
will do this most effectively, but it
interferes with giving the young plants the
fresh air they need. Therefore I would prefer
the shades, and depend upon removal to
a warmer place on extra-cold nights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Fresh air will be found a most important
factor in the growth of seedling plants indoors.
Unless it can be given it will be almost
impossible to grow any plant well in
the ordinary dwelling. It should be admitted
to the room on every pleasant day
by opening a window at the top, or a door
at some distance from the plants. The fresh,
cold air should be allowed to mix with the
warm air in the room before it comes in contact
with the plants, as a chill will often do
about as much damage as a touch of frost.</p>

<p>Watering these plants is a matter of prime
importance. Generally water is applied carelessly
and irregularly&mdash;too much to-day,
and none at all to-morrow. We saturate the
soil with it while only enough is required to
make it moist. An over-supply of water at
the roots, combined with too much heat
and lack of fresh air, will undermine the
constitution of any plant, because such a
combination excites unnatural development,
and this means a lowering of the vital force
to the danger-point.</p>

<p>I have devised a method by which I have
succeeded in controlling the supply of moisture
in the soil to my complete satisfaction.
I use boxes about four inches deep to start
my plants in. In the bottom of these boxes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
I put sphagnum moss. There should be
at least an inch of it after it has been pressed
down by the weight of the soil above. The
bottom of the seed-box is bored full of small
holes. Each box sets in a shallow pan of
galvanized iron, on a layer of coarse gravel,
which raises it enough to allow water to circulate
freely under it. Water is poured into
the iron pan, using enough to come up about
half an inch above the bottom of the seed-box,
or in contact with the moss in it, and it
should be kept at this height at all times.
The moss absorbs the moisture like a sponge,
and the soil above constantly sucks up all
that is needed to keep it in a sufficiently
moist condition to meet the requirements of
the plants growing in it. The absorbent
qualities of the moss are such that an excessive
amount of moisture is never communicated
to the soil above. Thus I secure a
steady and even supply, which does away
entirely with the danger resulting from the
application of water to the surface of the
soil from watering-pot or basin.</p>

<p>If the temperature can be controlled in
such a way that it will not vary much from
60 to 65°, if the soil can be kept moist but
never wet, and fresh air can be given in generous
quantity regularly, it will be found a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
comparatively easy matter to grow plants
satisfactorily from seed in the house, and have
them in such healthy condition by the time
it is safe to put them out in the garden that
they will average up well with the plants the
professional gardener raises in hotbed and
cold-frame. By the use of such plants, and
such plants only, can we expect to grow early
vegetables successfully.</p>

<h2 class="p4">VII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">STANDARD VARIETIES OF VEGETABLES</p>

<p class="pn p2">The amateur gardener will find it extremely
perplexing work to make a
satisfactory selection of <i>varieties</i> of vegetables
to grow in his garden. He knows
quite well, as a general thing, what <i>kinds</i>
he wants to grow, but when he comes to a
consultation of the seedsmen's catalogues he
discovers that of each <i>kind</i> of vegetable
listed therein there are so many <i>varieties</i>
mentioned that he is bewildered. Most of
them are described as being so desirable that
he cannot help getting the impression that
if he rules out this or that one he is likely
to deprive himself of the very thing from
which he would obtain the highest degree of
satisfaction. Nine times out of ten he finds,
after going through the catalogues and marking
the kinds and varieties that appeal to
him most forcibly, that he has a list which
would furnish enough seed to supply an
average-sized market-garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>I would advise the amateur gardener to
attempt the culture of only a few of the many
varieties described in the catalogues, and
these of the very best. But what constitutes
"the very best" is a hard matter for him to
decide where all are described by adjectives
in the superlative degree. He will find, by
comparing the catalogues of the various
seed firms, that there are described in most
of them certain varieties of each kind of
vegetable that seem common to all, along
with many other varieties whose names differ
greatly, though the descriptions of them
indicate that there is not much difference in
quality, or in other general respects. If he
confines his selection to such varieties of
each kind as the various dealers list <i>under
the same names</i> in their catalogues he will be
making no mistake, for the fact that all
leading dealers carry these varieties in stock
is sufficient proof that they are standard
varieties, and of such superior merit that no
up-to-date dealer can afford to exclude them
from his list.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, Stowell's Evergreen
sweet-corn, and Champion of England pea.
<i>All</i> dealers handle these, because they <i>are</i>
standard, and always in demand because
their superior qualities have made them uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>versal
favorites wherever grown. But they
have other varieties of the same vegetable
of which each makes a specialty, under
names which will be found in no catalogue
but their own. Many of these are
doubtless possessors of all the good qualities
claimed for them, but this we cannot be sure
about. But the sorts which are common to
all are those of whose merit there can be no
two opinions. These are the varieties the
inexperienced gardener can select with the
assurance that he is getting the best thing
of its kind on the market.</p>

<p>In this chapter I propose to make mention
of only such kinds of vegetables as I have
grown in my own garden. I do this because
so many beginners in gardening prefer to
depend on the advice of some one who has
familiarized himself with the merits of the
various vegetables adapted to ordinary gardening.
And I propose to give with each
such brief cultural directions as seem of most
importance, thus making it possible for the
amateur to avoid some of the mistakes that
might be made if he were wholly ignorant
of the requirements of his plants. After
having experimented with many kinds I have
pinned my faith to the kinds I shall make
mention of, and I have no hesitancy in recommending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
them to the attention of all gardeners,
feeling confident that a trial of them will
bear me out in the statement that no better
list can be made. There <i>may</i> be others of
equal or superior merit, but if there are I
have still to find out what they are.</p>


<h3><i>Asparagus</i></h3>

<p>Taking the list alphabetically, the first
vegetable to consider is asparagus. Conover's
Colossal seems to combine all the
merits of the several varieties on the market
in such a degree as to give it a place at the
head of the list of desirable kinds for ordinary
garden culture. It is tender, fine-flavored,
and very productive. A dozen plants, after
becoming well established, will furnish all
that will be required by a family of four or
five persons.</p>

<p>In order to secure good crops of this delicious
vegetable it will be necessary to dig
up the soil in which it is to be planted to
the depth of two or three feet, and fill the
bottom of the excavation with strong manure.
Pack this down firmly, and then return to
the trench the soil thrown out from it, fertilizing
this well as you do so. While asparagus
will grow in a soil that is not at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
rich, and will live on indefinitely under all
kinds of neglect and abuse, it must be given
plenty of strong food and good care in order
to enable it to do itself justice. I would not
advise attempting to grow it from seed, as it
takes a long time for seedling plants to reach
maturity. I would get two- or three-year-old
plants. Set them about eighteen inches
apart and at least four inches below the surface.
Keep weeds and grass away from them.
Give the asparagus-bed a place in the garden
by itself, preferably along a fence or in some
location where it will not interfere with other
plants which call for the frequent use of the
garden-cultivator. On no account plant it
in that part of the garden where it will be
necessary to use a plow, for it is a plant that
must be left undisturbed if you would have
it do its best. Cover the beds with coarse
manure in the fall, and work this into the
soil about the plants in spring.</p>


<h3><i>Beans</i></h3>

<p>Mammoth Stringless Green Pod matures
early, and is very tender, fine-flavored, and
productive. It is a general favorite for the
home garden.</p>

<p>Golden Wax is later than the green-podded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
variety mentioned above. It is valuable as
a string-bean, and for shelling.</p>

<p>Beans are quite tender, therefore they
should not be planted until the weather becomes
warm and settled. Plant in rows two
feet apart, and about four inches apart in the
row, or in hills of three or four plants each.
Cultivate frequently during the early part
of summer, throwing the soil toward the
plants. Do not work among them while
they are wet from dew or rain.</p>

<p>If a pole-bean is wanted, Improved Lima
will be found extremely satisfactory because
of its productiveness and its fine, buttery
flavor. This class supplies the table with
shelled beans only, its pods being too tough
to use as a string-bean. Plant in hills of six
or eight, setting a pole six or seven feet tall
in the center of each hill for the plants to
climb by.</p>


<h3><i>Beet</i></h3>

<p>I would advise two varieties of this vegetable
where the garden is large enough to
warrant the use of more than one. Crosby's
Egyptian stands at the head of the list as an
early variety. It is remarkably tender, and
has a sugary flavor that is most delicious.
As a second variety I would advise Crimson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Globe. This is very sweet and fine-flavored,
and comes to perfection during the latter
part of summer. It is a good keeper, and a
quantity of it should be stored in the cellar
for winter use.</p>

<p>Sow seeds in rows sixteen to eighteen
inches apart. Sow thickly, and use the surplus
plants as greens while young and tender,
making use of both top and root. Thin to
three or four inches apart.</p>


<h3><i>Cabbage</i></h3>

<p>Unless the garden is of considerable size
I would not advise planting this vegetable,
because it takes up so much room that might
better be given to other kinds which the
housewife will find more useful. The plants
should stand at least two feet apart. Seed
can be put into the ground about the first of
May, or plants can be started in the hotbed
if wanted for very early use. Seedlings can
be transplanted as soon as they have made
their second leaf.</p>

<p>For a very early variety I would advise
Jersey Wakefield. For late use Late Drumhead
or Stone Mason Marblehead&mdash;both excellent
in all respects, and fine for winter use.</p>

<p>Care must be taken to prevent insects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
from injuring the plants during the various
stages of their development. Spray with an
infusion of the tobacco extract known as
Nicoticide. This will effectually prevent the
pests from doing harm if applied thoroughly
and frequently.</p>

<p>If cabbage is to be wintered in the cellar,
it must be kept cool and dry. Some prefer
to bury the heads in trenches, in dry locations
in the garden. The trench should be about
two feet deep. Spread straw in the bottom
of it, and place the cabbage on it, head down,
with the large leaves folded well together.
Then cover with three or four inches of hay,
and bank up with soil. Put a board over
this to shed rain. The cabbage will freeze,
but if left in the ground until the frost is
gradually extracted from it it will be found
crisp and brittle, and much more satisfactory
for table use than that which is wintered in
the cellar. Care must be taken to exclude
rain. If water gets to it it will be ruined.
It is a good plan to cover the trench with
oilcloth or tarred paper, both being waterproof.</p>


<h3><i>Cauliflower</i></h3>

<p>This is a favorite vegetable when well
grown and properly cared for. It requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
a rich soil, a location well exposed to the
sun, and frequent applications of water if
the season happens to be a dry one. Cultivate
as you would cabbage. For early use
the plants should be started in the hotbed,
and transplanted to the cold-frame as soon
as they have made their third leaves. Put
into the open ground as soon as the soil is
in good working condition. Set the plants
about two feet apart. When heads have
formed they should be bleached by drawing
the large leaves together and tying them with
strips of soft cloth.</p>

<p>For a late crop, to mature during the
pickling season, start plants in open ground
in May.</p>

<p>The best early variety is Dwarf Erfurt.
Autumn Giant is an excellent late variety.</p>


<h3><i>Carrot</i></h3>

<p>This plant likes a deep, warm, sandy soil.
Early Short Horn matures by midsummer.
It is rich and sweet in flavor. Red Intermediate
is a later variety, excellent for fall
and winter use. Comparatively few persons
give this plant a place in their gardens, but
it richly deserves a place there because of its
value as an article of food, as well as because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of its health-giving qualities. It adds greatly
to the variety of the bill of fare, and where
it appears frequently on the table a liking for
it is soon developed, and thereafter it becomes
a standard vegetable in the housewife's
list of "must-haves." It adds a delightful
flavor to vegetable soups.</p>


<h3><i>Celery</i></h3>

<p>The seed of early celery should be sown in
the hotbed. Transplant the seedlings to the
cold-frame and allow them to remain there
until May. Then set in the richest soil at
your disposal, six inches apart in the row.
Blanch by setting up boards a foot or more
in width each side the row, allowing an opening
about three inches wide at the top
through which the plants can get a little
light. For late and winter use, sow the seeds
in open ground in May. Bleach by earthing
up gradually, as the stalks develop, until you
have the plants buried to within a few inches
of the tip of their leaves. Use clean, dry
soil in banking the plants. Sawdust is good,
but care must be taken to make use of a
kind that does not have a strong odor. Pine-dust
will give the plants a disagreeable flavor.</p>

<p>For winter use, take up plants, root and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
all, and pack close together in boxes and store
in a cool, dark cellar.</p>

<p>White Plume is the best early variety.
Giant Pascal is probably the most satisfactory
winter variety, but Winter Queen is
a favorite with many. Both are so tender
and have such a rich, nutty flavor that it
is not an easy matter to decide between them.</p>


<h3><i>Cucumber</i></h3>

<p>For very early cucumbers plant the seed
in the hotbed in March or April, but do not
put the plants into the garden until all danger
of frost is over. This plant requires a
rich and mellow soil. It should be set in
hills at least four feet apart. It is a good
plan to start the seed in pieces of sod placed
grass-side down. This enables one to move
them from the hotbed without any disturbance
of their roots. The cucumber- or
squash-beetle often destroys the plants when
they are put in the open ground if close
watch is not taken and prompt effort made
to rout the enemy. Spray with Nicoticide
infusion, taking pains to have it reach the
under side of the leaves. Dry road-dust
sifted thickly over the plants is often found
quite effective, but because of the inability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to apply it to the under side of the leaves
the liquid insecticide will be found more effective.</p>

<p>Improved Early White Spine is a favorite
with all who like a crisp, tender-meated,
finely flavored cucumber. Ever-bearing is
an excellent sort for pickling as well as for
use on the table during the fall, as it continues
to bear until frost kills the vines.</p>


<h3><i>Corn</i></h3>

<p>Sweet-corn is one of the most delicious of
all garden vegetables, and every garden that
is large enough to admit of its culture should
give place to two or three varieties of it.
Because of its tall growth and the distance
required between rows it is not adapted to
culture in the very small garden, though I
would willingly go without some of the other
vegetables generally grown there in order
to give place to a few hills of it.</p>

<p>Golden Bantam produces ears only four or
five inches in length, but what they lack in
size they make up for in tenderness and sweetness.</p>

<p>Country Gentleman is a medium variety,
very tender, sweet, and juicy.</p>

<p>But the ideal sweet-corn is Stowell's Evergreen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
No other variety equals it in tenderness,
sugary sweetness, and rich flavor. It
does not come to maturity until quite late in
the season, but it remains in excellent eating-condition
until the plant is killed by frost.</p>

<p>Do not plant until the weather and the
ground are warm&mdash;generally about May
10th at the extreme North. Sweet-corn seed
often decays if put into the ground as early
as field-corn. Have the soil rich and mellow,
and cultivate frequently and thoroughly. If
a dry spell comes along make use of the cultivator
daily until the drought is broken.</p>


<h3><i>Endive</i></h3>

<p>This plant ought to be grown far more
extensively than it is because it is one of the
best salad plants we have for fall and winter
use. Some should be sown in April for use
during the summer, and some in July, for
late use. When the plants are two or three
inches high transplant to rich soil, setting
them about ten inches apart. When nearly
full-grown, gather the leaves together and
tie them with strips of cloth, thus excluding
the light from the central part of the bunch.
It must be blanched before it is fit for table
use. This part of the work must be done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
while the plants are perfectly dry. If done
when they are wet or even moist, they will
be quite sure to rot.</p>


<h3>Lettuce</h3>

<p>This plant should be started in the hotbed
if there is one. The seedlings should be
transferred to the cold-frame before they
have attained much size, and left there until
the ground becomes warm. Very fine lettuce,
however, can be grown from seed sown
directly in the open ground about the first
of May, if the soil is warm and rich. A fertile
soil is quite important, as it is necessary
to bring on a rapid growth in order to have
the plant crisp and tender. Slow development
gives a comparatively worthless article.</p>

<p>The All Heart variety is excellent for spring
and early summer use. It forms a solid
head, and is very crisp and tender, with that
rich, buttery flavor that the lover of this
plant insists on. Mammoth Salamander is
one of the best late-season kinds.</p>


<h3>Melons</h3>

<p>These, like corn and cabbage, are not
adapted to culture in the small garden because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
they require more room than it is possible
to give them without giving up other
vegetables which the housewife cannot well
afford to go without. But in good-sized
gardens I would advise their culture, because
there is nothing else quite equal to them in
delicacy of flavor and luscious sweetness.
They require a light, rich soil. Plant when
the ground is warm, and not before, in hills
four feet apart. It is a good plan to put a
generous quantity of manure from the henhouse
in each hill, working it well into the
soil before seed is planted. Put at least a
dozen seed in each hill, for some of the seedlings
will doubtless be destroyed by the beetle
that works on cucumber- and squash-vines.
Spray all over with Nicoticide infusion as
soon as the first beetle is seen, also shower
with dry road-dust. If a fungous disease attacks
them spray with Bordeaux mixture.</p>

<p>Rocky Ford is the standard variety of
muskmelon at present. It has a thick greenish-yellow
flesh, is smooth-grained, is very
sweet, has a most delicious flavor, and is so
tender that it fairly seems to melt in the
mouth. Netted Gem is another standard
variety.</p>

<p>Among the watermelons Ice-Cream is a
general favorite. Mammoth Ironclad grows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to a very large size, is solid-meated, and has
a peculiarly sweet and luscious flavor.</p>


<h3>Onion</h3>

<p>This should be sown in light, sandy soil,
if possible, as it seldom does well in a heavy
soil.</p>

<p>Yellow Danvers is the leading variety for
the home garden. Silverskin has a mild
flavor, and on that account it is a favorite
with many. It is fine for pickling. It also
keeps well in winter.</p>


<h3>Parsley</h3>

<p>Sow this plant thickly, in April, in rows
of mellow soil. As the seed germinates very
slowly, it is well to soak it in warm water before
sowing. If you have a light cellar,
plants can be potted in fall and stored there
for winter use. The cellar window is a good
place for them. Every housewife who prides
herself on the attractive appearance of her
roasts and other meat dishes and many kinds
of salad will not be willing to be without
this plant. Dwarf Perpetual is the standard
variety for the home garden. Its leaves are
charmingly crimped and curly, and of beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
dark green that makes them very ornamental
when used as a garnish for the table.</p>


<h3>Parsnip</h3>

<p>This vegetable is not grown as much as it
ought to be. One does not care for it until
winter sets in. Then it affords a much-appreciated
change from other vegetables.
It is an excellent keeper when stored in the
cellar in winter. Or the roots can be left
in the ground until spring, when they will
be found delightfully fresh and tender. Sow
in April or May, in deep, rich soil. Hollow
Crown is the standard variety.</p>


<h3>Pea</h3>

<p>This vegetable is so extremely hardy that it
can be planted with entire safety quite early
in spring. There are varieties that come into
bearing a few weeks after sowing, followed
by medium early kinds, which give place, a
little later, to such varieties as Champion of
England and Telephone. Champion of England
is the most delicious of all peas.</p>

<p>Unless the garden is a very small one, one
should plan for a succession. If this is done
it will be possible to enjoy this vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
during the greater part of the season, with
possibly the exception of the very hottest
part of summer. Best results are secured by
planting the seed two or three inches deep in
furrows. The soil should be rich. If there
is a little clay in it, all the better.</p>

<p>Low-growing varieties require no support,
but the tall kinds must be bushed or trained
on coarse-meshed wire netting. Bushes suit
this plant better than anything else. If the
vines are allowed to crinkle down and come
in contact with the ground their pods will
almost always decay, and the vines will
mildew and become so diseased that an end
will be put to their bearing.</p>

<p>American Wonder is one of the best very
early kinds. Gradus is next in order. Advancer
I consider the best medium variety.
Telephone is a most excellent late variety,
second only to Champion of England, which
is everywhere conceded to be the ideal pea
so far as productiveness, size, rich flavor,
and sweetness are concerned.</p>


<h3>Potato</h3>

<p>Anybody can grow the potato, <i>after a
fashion</i>. But in order to grow it <i>well</i> it must
receive more attention than is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
given it. It must have a rich and mellow
soil&mdash;a sandy one is preferable&mdash;and the
best of cultivation.</p>

<p>This is one of the vegetables that require
considerable room, therefore it is not adapted
to small-garden culture. But when space will
admit of it it should always be grown, because
it is one of the garden products that
can be used in so many ways that the housewife
finds it one of the things she cannot well
get along without.</p>

<p>Seed is obtained by cutting old potatoes
in pieces, each piece having an "eye" or
growing-point. The pieces should be planted
in hills, four or five pieces to a hill, with hills
two feet apart. Cover to a depth of four inches.</p>

<p>If plants are not watched while small, insects
are likely to attack them. Spray with
Nicoticide infusion. Later in the season the
Colorado beetle will be quite likely to put
in its appearance. Then use Paris green,
either in infusion, or mixed with land-plaster,
and applied in a dry state while the plants
are moist from dew. If any fungous disease
is discovered, spray with Bordeaux mixture.
All these insecticides can be procured from
druggists or dealers in agricultural goods,
or they can be obtained from the dealer from
whom you buy seed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well to plant this vegetable for a succession.
One of the best early varieties is
Beauty of Hebron, which matures in eight
to ten weeks from planting. Early Rose is
everywhere a favorite, as is Early Ohio.
Rural New-Yorker is a standard late variety.
Burbank's Seedling is excellent as an intermediate
sort. All the varieties named are
of superior flavor, very productive, and sure
to give complete satisfaction.</p>


<h3>Radish</h3>

<p>This most toothsome vegetable should be
sown early, either in the hotbed or the open
ground. If you have a light, warm soil and
a location that is fully exposed to the sun
you can raise almost as fine radishes outside
of the hotbed as in it, though of course not
as early in the season. A crop will develop
in five or six weeks from sowing. Plant at
intervals of two or three weeks for a succession.
Cardinal Globe is the standard
early variety. Crimson Giant is a little later.
Both have that crisp, tender, and juicy quality
which makes the radish so universal a
favorite. Icicle is a long-growing white variety,
very crisp and brittle. This has the merit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of remaining in condition for use longer than
any other variety.</p>


<h3>Rhubarb</h3>

<p>This plant likes a deep, rich, and rather
moist soil. It should be planted in permanent
beds, about three feet apart. I would
not advise attempting to grow it from seed.
Get roots one or two years old. Victoria is
a standard variety.</p>


<h3>Salsify</h3>

<p>A vegetable that ought to be grown a
great deal more than it is. Its popular
name of "vegetable oyster" is not a misnomer,
for it has a distinct oyster flavor. Many
persons prefer it to the bivalve, when it is
cooked properly. Being hardy, it can be
left in the ground over winter, or it can be
dug and stored in the cellar along with parsnips
and carrots for use in winter. Sow
early.</p>


<h3>Squash</h3>

<p>Probably the best variety of summer
squash for home use is Giant Crook Neck.
For winter use the Hubbard stands at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
head of the list. These favorite vegetables
require a rich soil. They should be planted
in hills about three feet apart. Have the
soil rich. Keep watch of them, for they are
liable to attacks from beetles. It is well to
sprinkle a handful of tobacco-dust about the
young plants. As they become larger they
can be sprayed with the Nicoticide infusion
heretofore spoken of.</p>


<h3>Spinach</h3>

<p>Desirable for "greens." Sow as early in
the spring as the ground is in good working
condition. Have the soil quite rich to force
a tender, succulent growth. Sow for succession,
a month apart. The Long-Season
variety is the best I have any knowledge of.</p>


<h3>Tomato</h3>

<p>Start this plant in the hotbed if you have
one. If not, sow in the open ground as soon
as it has become warm. To secure a very
early crop the plants must be started as
early as March. When three or four inches
high transplant from hotbed to cold-frame,
but do not put into the open ground until all
danger from frost is over. If you are without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
hotbed facilities I would advise purchasing
plants from the gardener, who tries to supply
his customers with strong and healthy plants
very early in the season. Plants from seed
sown in the open ground will be so late in
ripening a crop, as a general thing, that they
will not afford satisfaction. Standard varieties
are Stone, very solid and firm-fleshed
and of fine quality, and Ponderosa, very
large, fine-flavored, and almost seedless.</p>

<h2 class="p4">VIII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">SMALL FRUITS AND THEIR CULTURE</p>

<p class="pn p2">Quite as important as garden vegetables
is the small-fruit department of each
home that is living up to its privileges. Of
course there will be no room for raspberries
and blackberries on the little home lot, but
one can have a row of strawberries there, in
almost all cases, and a few currant-bushes
can be tucked away in nooks and corners
where quite likely nothing else would be
grown if the tiny space were not given up to
them.</p>

<p>There are places all over the country where
a collection of small fruit ought to be grown,
but which are without it. Why?</p>

<p>There are several answers to the question.
One is: Neglect to live up to the possibilities
of the place because of carelessness, or possibly
because the owner is distrustful of his
ability to grow them successfully. Another
is: The impression that these plants are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
exacting in their demands that none but
skilled gardeners are warranted in undertaking
their culture. And a third one is: The
uncertainty of being unable to take them
through our severe Northern winters safely.</p>

<p>The first objection is met with the argument
that the man who is obliged to work
for a living, and has a family to support,
has no excuse for neglecting to avail himself
and those dependent on him of all the good
things that can be grown from the plants
named, if he owns a piece of ground large
enough to accommodate a small collection.
The second objection is not justified, because
it is an easy matter for any man to learn
how to care for small fruits if he sets about it
with the intention of mastering its details.
There is really no basis in fact for the third
one, for we have, to-day, varieties of each
kind of small fruit that are entirely hardy at
the North if properly cared for in the fall.</p>

<p>There should be a strawberry-bed, large
or small, in every garden, if I had my way
about it.</p>

<p>Here I suppose some reader will meet me
with the objection that "strawberries don't
pay. They require too much care, and the
beds soon run out, and then everything has
to be done over again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Now I claim that strawberries <i>do</i> pay if
they get the right kind of treatment. No
one has a right to expect much from them if
he simply sticks a plant into the soil and
leaves it to take care of itself thereafter.
Strawberries cultivated in this manner <i>don't</i>
pay, I admit. And it is well that they do
not, for no one has a right to expect much,
if anything, from a plant of any kind that he
isn't willing to take good care of. While the
strawberry will not take care of itself, it
really requires no more attention than most
other crops. And as to "running out," that
cuts no figure, when you come to think
about it, because "doing things all over
again" amounts to no more than planting
vegetables each season. This has to be done
yearly, and strawberries will demand only
annual attention, thus putting the two classes
of plants on practically the same basis.</p>

<p>I am aware that some writers on strawberry
culture have ventilated a good many
far-fetched ideas of their own in print relative
to the culture of this plant, and so
elaborate and complicated are some of these
theories that many an amateur has, after
reading them, abandoned the idea of having
a strawberry-bed. But it is a fact susceptible
of proof by any man who gives it a trial that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
strawberry culture may be made a success
without adopting the views of persons who
seem to think that theory is more important
than common sense.</p>

<p>The simplest method of strawberry-growing
that I know anything about is what is
called the "one-crop system."</p>

<p>Set the plants in rows three feet apart,
to allow the use of the cultivator between
them. Let the plants be a foot apart in the
row. Keep the ground between the rows
well cultivated, and in the second summer,
when the plants are bearing their first crop
of fruit, allow them to send their runners
into the space between the rows and take
root there. When these young plants have
fully established themselves&mdash;which will be
by the end of August, as a general thing&mdash;take
a spade and cut down between them
and the old plants. Then dig up the old
plants, making the place where they grew
a space between rows. Next season train
runners from the bearing plants back into
the old row. By thus alternating the location
of the plants you keep the garden supplied
with one-year-old ones from which
you get but one crop of fruit. This method
is so simple that any one can understand it,
and it has the indorsement of some of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
most up-to-date gardeners who recognize the
fact that one full crop of berries is about all
that can be expected from the strawberry.
Of course older plants will bear fruit, but
never of the quantity and quality which is
obtained from strong, healthy young plants
whose vitality has not been drawn upon by
the production of a heavy first crop.</p>

<p>This one-crop system makes it possible to
grow fine berries without giving the plants
more care than is required by ordinary vegetables.</p>

<p>The soil for strawberries should be rich and
mellow, and should be kept entirely free from
weeds.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to spread clean straw
between the rows before the crop ripens, to
keep the fruit from coming in contact with
the ground or having sand washed upon it
by heavy rains.</p>

<p>The best variety of strawberry that I have
ever grown is Brandywine. It is very productive,
bears large berries, has a most delicious
flavor, and is never hollow-hearted.
It ripens in mid-season.</p>

<p>The best late variety, allowing me to be
judge, is Gandy. This kind requires a very
rich soil. Where it can be given this, no
more satisfactory late-cropper can be grown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
The two varieties named above combine all
the best qualities of this most popular fruit.</p>

<p>Several times in the last few years the announcement
has been made that a fall-bearing
strawberry has been produced, but as it
was of European origin it did not prove satisfactory
under American conditions. Of late,
however, some of our most progressive small-fruit
growers have succeeded in growing two
varieties that promise to be really good fall-croppers.
These produce, if allowed to do
so, their main crop at the same time as other
varieties, and keep on bearing until frost.
But in order to secure a good crop late in the
season it is advisable to cut away all buds
that appear in June, keeping the strength
of the plant in reserve for the fall crop. It
is well to mulch these plants during the hot,
dry weather of summer. These fall-bearing
varieties are on the market under the names
of Superb and Progressive.</p>

<p class="p2">The blackberry responds generously to
good treatment, bearing enormous quantities
of large, juicy berries of most delicious
flavor when given proper care.</p>

<p>It prefers a rather sandy soil.</p>

<p>In order to secure a fresh stock of wood
for each season's crop the old canes should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
be cut away as soon as they have ripened
their fruit, thus throwing all the strength of
the plant into the production of new canes
from which fruit is to be expected next season.</p>

<p>While the two leading varieties, Kittatinny
and Snyder, are quite hardy, it is well to take
the precaution of giving them some protection
to guard against the possible loss of some
of the unripened growth of the season. This
is done to the best advantage by removing
two or three spadefuls of soil from the base
of each plant, close to its roots, and then
tipping the bush over until it lies flat on the
ground. This could not be done without
running the risk of breaking some of the
stiff and brittle canes if the excavation were
not made. When the bushes are spread out
on the ground, where they are held in place
by laying boards across them, throw some
coarse litter over the base of the plant, and
scatter a covering of straw over the branches.
As soon as the frost is out of the ground in
the spring, lift the bushes and replace the soil
that was taken away in the fall.</p>

<p class="p2">Raspberries are second only to strawberries
in deliciousness of flavor, and should have a
place in all gardens where there is room for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
them. They do well in almost all soils, if
well drained. A sandy loam, however, is the
soil that seems to suit them best. Their old
canes, like those of the blackberry, should
be cut away at the end of the fruiting season.</p>

<p>Cuthbert is the leading red variety. Cumberland
is the favorite black kind.</p>

<p class="b1">I notice that one of our most prominent
growers of small fruit offers an ever-bearing
raspberry this season, under the name of
Red Ranere. I have no knowledge of its
merits other than that which I gain from the
grower's announcement in introducing this
sort to the market, but from intimate personal
acquaintance with the man I am quite
confident that the plant must possess real
merit, for he is not a person given to exaggeration.
I quote from what he has to say in
reference to this variety in a leading horticultural
magazine:</p>

<p class="pbq">This is not only the earliest red raspberry, but it
is a perpetual fruiting one. Its main crop is greater
than that of any other variety I grow. It continues
to bear on its old canes until late in August, at about
which time the canes of the season's growth come
into bearing. These produce a large amount of fine
fruit until late in the fall. The berries are very attractive,
being a bright, rich crimson. They are of
good size, and of very superior quality, with a rich,
sugary, full raspberry flavor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">I would advise the amateur gardener to
give this variety a trial. Raspberries late in
the fall would be thoroughly appreciated by
those with whom this fruit is a favorite.</p>

<p class="p2">The currant is one of the garden's indispensables.
It furnishes us with fruit of just
the right degree of tart acidity to fit the season
in which it is at its prime, and who does
not get a deal of enjoyment out of a green-currant
pie?</p>

<p>No kind of small fruit is easier to grow
successfully. Worms frequently attack the
bushes in spring, and often ruin the crop
unless steps are taken to put a prompt end
to their depredations, but spraying with
Nicoticide infusion will rout them in most
cases. Application of this insecticide should
be repeated at intervals during the earlier
part of the season.</p>

<p>Fay's Prolific is a standard variety for
home use. This is a dark, rich red, most
beautiful to behold. White Grape is an
ideal white variety. Combine the two and
you have a table decoration quite as colorful
as that furnished by any flowers, and almost
as attractive.</p>

<p class="p2">The currant is one of the housewife's most
valued fruits for jam- and jelly-making. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
enterprising dealer has recently introduced
to this country a French sort known as Bar-le-Duc,
or Preserving Currant. This variety
has a flavor that no other variety can lay
claim to, and another feature of merit peculiar
to it is that it is almost seedless. For a
good many years the entire output of this
currant was under the control of a French
fruit company who manufactured it into
jam which has been extensively sold in this
country under the name of Confiture Bar-le-Duc.
So superior has it been considered
to home-made as well as imported jams, that
it has readily sold at double the price of them.
I would advise the amateur to procure a few
plants of this variety and experiment with it.</p>

<p class="p2">The gooseberry must not be overlooked in
this connection. Many persons claim that
the bush mildews to such an extent that the
crop is oftener than not a failure. This can
largely be prevented by planting the bushes
farther apart than the currant, and thinning
out the branches so that there will at all
times be a free circulation of air about them.
It is well to give a heavy mulch of coarse
manure in the hot weather of summer. Spray
with the infusion recommended for currants
to prevent injury from worms. If mildew of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
an apparently fungous nature attacks the
plants, spray with Bordeaux mixture.</p>

<p class="p2">This hardly seems the place in which to
say much about the culture of the apple,
plum, pear, and cherry, for that is a phase of
gardening quite distinct from that which
this little book aims to interest the homemaker
in. However, the writer would urge
having all these fruits when conditions are
favorable to their culture. The more fruit
we eat the healthier we will be.</p>

<p>All kinds of small fruit can be planted in
spring to better advantage than in fall,
though the nurseryman will tell you, if you
consult him, that it makes little difference
whether you plant in spring or fall. The
writer has tried both methods, and he has
always been most successful when plants were
put out in April and May, provided they were
sent from the nursery that spring. If they
are sent in fall they should be "heeled-in"
over winter. "Heeling-in" consists in burying
the roots in a place where they will be
kept dry during the winter. It will not be
necessary to cover all the top, though there
is no objection to this if the owner thinks it
safer to do so. Care should be taken to keep
the plants well protected from storms. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
can be done very effectively by spreading
tarred paper over them, pains being taken
to weight it down with stones or something
else equally heavy to prevent its being blown
out of place.</p>

<p>Plants that have been "heeled-in" over
winter should be set out as soon as possible
in spring.</p>

<p class="pn center mid">HOTBEDS AND COLD-FRAMES</p>

<p class="pn p2">In order to have vegetables early in the
season it will be necessary to give them
a start some weeks before the ground is in
proper condition for the reception of seed.
Sometimes this is done by sowing the seed in
pots and boxes in the living-room, as advised
in Chapter VI, but here conditions are
not very favorable to healthy growth, unless
great care is taken to follow the directions
given in the chapter mentioned, and
even then success does not always attend
our efforts.</p>

<p>In order to give our plants the early start
that they must have if we want vegetables
at a time when most gardeners are getting
the garden ready for planting, we must
make use of the hotbed. If this is done we
can gain from six weeks to two months in
time, and have lettuce and radishes before
our neighbors who are without hotbed facilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
consider it safe to put seed into the
ground.</p>

<p>At the North the first of March is quite
early enough to get the hotbed under way.</p>

<p>I am aware that many young gardeners
have the impression that a hotbed is, in some
respects, a mysterious thing, and because of
this they do not undertake to make one. Now
there is nothing simpler than a hotbed when
you come to a study of it. It is simply making
a place in which summer conditions can
be imitated by supplying it with steady,
gentle heat, and in confining this heat within
an inclosure. The heat is generated by the
use of material which ferments, and the inclosure
is nothing but a combination of boards
and glass so arranged that the temperature
inside it can be regulated to suit the requirements
of the plants you undertake to grow
in it.</p>

<p>The heat-generating material is generally
fresh manure from the horse-stable, or a
mixture of that and coarse litter.</p>

<p>Because the heat from rapid fermentation
is quite intense, at first the material from
which it is obtained should be prepared before
the hotbed is brought into use. A quantity
of it should be spread on the site selected
for the hotbed&mdash;which should be one that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
high and dry&mdash;covering a space larger than
the hotbed frame is to be. Spread it in layers
four or five inches deep, tramping each layer
down well. When there is a foot and a half
of it, cover it with something that will shed
rain, and wait for fermentation to take place.
A warm moisture will rise from it like steam.
After two or three days fork the material
over, and remove all straw, and make another
heap similar to the first one, taking
great pains to have it firm and compact. It
is very important that it should have considerable
solidity, as a heap of loose litter
will never give satisfactory results. There
should be at least a foot and a half of this
heat-generating material.</p>

<p>While waiting for fermentation to take
place in the manure-pile, prepare the frame
for your hotbed.</p>

<p>Let it be about a foot and a half in depth
at the back, and eight or ten inches deep in
front, with sides that slope from the wider
boards to the narrower ones. Cover it with
glass set in sash. If possible have the sash
hinged to the back-board, so that it can be
lifted for ventilation without removing it.</p>

<p>The best location for a hotbed is one facing
the south, that all possible advantage can
be taken of sunshine, and against a building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
or fence that will protect it on the north
from cold winds. Some persons prefer to
make an excavation a foot or more in depth
for the reception of the heating material,
but this is not a matter of much importance.
As a general thing it will not be possible to
do this in a satisfactory manner while there is
frost in the ground, as there will be at the
North until after the first of March.</p>

<p>When the first stages of fermentation are
over, set the hotbed frame in place, and fill
in with five or six inches of very fine, rich
soil. This is what your seed is to be planted
in.</p>

<p>The young gardener will be surprised at
the amount of heat contained in an inclosure
like the one described. It will be very similar
to the weather conditions of early or
middle May out of doors. In it plants will
grow healthily and vigorously, provided they
are given plenty of fresh air. This is a matter
of the greatest importance. Unless your
seedlings are aired daily, if the weather is
pleasant, they will make a rapid but weak
growth, and when the time comes to put them
in the cold-frame or the open ground&mdash;provided
they are alive then&mdash;they will be so
lacking in vitality that the change will be
pretty sure to put an end to them. On every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
sunny or warm day the sash should be lifted
an inch or two, about ten o'clock, and left
in that condition until about two. Care must
be taken, however, to see that the wind does
not blow from a quarter that will drive the
cold air in upon the plants. The admission
of a cold blast will often be fatal to the tender
plants.</p>

<p>Great caution must be exercised in regard
to ventilation. The aim should be, at all
times, to admit pure, fresh air without allowing
cold to enter with it. This may seem
a somewhat paradoxical statement, for at
first thought it will seem impossible for air
from without to come in without taking along
with it the cold air which is in circulation
outside, but when one takes into consideration
the fact that the warm air inside the hotbed
meets the air from out of doors at the point
of entrance it will be understood that it
repels or counteracts it to an extent that
makes it safe to open the sash slightly when
the outside temperature is nearly down to
freezing-point. The hotbed-owner must study
existing conditions and be governed accordingly.
It is impossible to lay down any
hard-and-fast rules to apply in this case.</p>

<p>On cold nights the hotbed sash should be
covered with blankets or old carpeting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
prevent the formation of frost on the glass.
If you find, in the morning, that the glass is
covered with moisture on its under side,
raise the sash a trifle and leave it so until the
moisture clears away.</p>

<p>If at any time you have reason to think
that the warmth inside the frame is decreasing
too rapidly, bank up about it with fresh
fermenting material.</p>

<p>After constructing the hotbed and putting
the frame and sash in place, test the
heat inside by an accurate thermometer
before venturing to sow any seed. When
it registers 85° or 90° the bed is ready for
seeding.</p>

<p>In making the frame for a hotbed care
should be taken to see that all joints fit snugly.
A great deal of cold can be admitted
through a very small crevice. A few cracks
will let out the heat faster than it is generated,
therefore see to it that in constructing the
frame a good piece of work is done.</p>

<p>Some persons tell me that they always
bank up a hotbed with earth. This enables
it to retain the heat better than it is possible
for it to do without banking.</p>

<p>A hotbed will be of no particular benefit
unless supplemented by a cold-frame. This
is simply a snug inclosure of boards covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
with glass, into which plants from the hotbed
are to be set for the purpose of hardening
them off before they are put into the open
ground. In other words, it is a hotbed without
heat. The temperature in it ought to
register from 60° to 65°. Raise the sash an
inch or two on sunny days before the rays
of the sun striking on the glass raise the
temperature inside to a degree too intense
for the good of your plants.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood from what I
have said above that in order to attain success
in the management of a hotbed great
care will have to be exercised at all times
and frequent attention given. It is not a self-regulating
thing by any means. You will
have to consider the weather, the time of day
when ventilation should be given, frequency
of watering, and other matters which cannot
be touched on here because of a more or less
local character.</p>

<p>Plants in the hotbed should be watered
cautiously. An over-supply will often cause
the seedlings to "damp off," and a lack of
sufficient moisture at the roots will speedily
result in injury, if not death. Whenever
water is applied, use a sprinkler that throws
a fine spray. If thrown on the soil in a stream
the water will often wash the smaller plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
out of place. It may puzzle one to tell when
<i>just enough</i> has been given. This is best determined
by an examination of the soil. If
moderately moist there is plenty of moisture
below.</p>

<p class="pn center mid">SMALL GARDENS</p>

<p class="pn p2">Many persons who would like to grow
flowers and vegetables do not attempt
to grow any because they do not consider
that they have a place large enough to justify
them in doing so.</p>

<p>Here is where they make a mistake. A
garden need not be a large one to be enjoyable.
A few plants are better than none.
It is possible to make a bit of garden more
satisfactory than a large one because it will
be more likely to get more attention than
would be given to the larger one, and attention
is one of the important features of
any successful garden.</p>

<p>There will, in the majority of cases, be
little nooks and corners here and there about
the home grounds in which some plants can
be grown by those disposed to make the most
of existing conditions. These, if not improved,
will be pretty sure to be given over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to weeds, or to the accumulation of rubbish
of one kind or another, and they will detract
from the tidy and clean appearance which
should characterize the home everywhere.
If the owners of these bits of ground&mdash;these
possibilities for adding to the attractiveness
of home&mdash;could be made to realize the amount
of pleasure they could be made to afford with
very little exertion on their part, the general
work of civic improvement societies would
be most beneficial, and this would be done
at the very place where civic improvement
ought to start&mdash;the home. There can be
no real and lasting improvement in civic
undertaking unless the individual home takes
up the matter. The civic improvement
society that starts out with the idea of improving
things generally, but does not begin
the good work <i>at the home</i> is working on the
idea of making clean the outside of the cup
and ignoring the condition inside it. Just
as the home is the foundation of society, so
must it be made the pivotal point at which
any substantial and lasting improvement
finds its beginning.</p>

<p>Because the scattered places about the
small home in which few plants could be
grown will not admit of bed-making, or the
"designs" which many persons seem to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
indispensable in gardening, is no good reason
why we should not take advantage of and
make the most of them. If one lives in a
community where there are German families
he will be surprised at the amount of vegetables
they grow in each home-lot. Not an
inch of soil is allowed to go to waste. A
large amount of the food of the family is
grown in places which most Americans would
overlook, simply because of the prevailing
idea that unless one can do things on a
large scale it is not worth while to attempt
doing anything. The German has been
brought up to not "despise the day of small
things," and he profits by the advice. As
we might, if we would, and, I am glad to say,
as more and more are profiting by year by
year as they become aware of the fact that
much can be done where conditions are limited.</p>

<p>I would not advise much mixing of varieties.
On the contrary, I would prefer to
give over each little piece of ground to one
plant. Those of low habit I would have
near the path, giving the places back of
them to taller-growing kinds. Of course,
in the majority of small homes, there is not
much chance for exercising a choice in the
location of one's flowering or vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
plants; still, it is well to study the possibilities
for general effect, and do all that can be
done to secure pleasing results. Where
plants that grow to a height of three feet
are grown, the best place for them is at the
rear, or along the boundary of the lot, where
they will serve as a background for plants
of lower habit.</p>

<p>Children should be encouraged to take
an interest in the cultivation of small gardens.
They will do this if the parents are willing
to help them a little at the start. Show them
how to spade up the soil in spring, and how
to work it over and over until it is fine and
mellow. They will make play of this part of
garden work, as it is as natural for a child to
dig in the dirt as it is for a pig to wallow in
a mud-puddle. Add some kind of fertilizer
to the soil, and explain to the boys and girls
that it is food for the plants that are to be.
Show them how to sow seed, and tell them
all you can about the processes of germination,
and encourage them to watch for the
appearance of the seedlings. In a short time
you will have aroused in them such interest
in the work they have undertaken that it
will be as fascinating to them as a story,
and nature will take delight in writing it
out for them in daily instalments that constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
increase in interest. The ability to
know plants and how to grow them ought
to be a part of every child's education.</p>

<p>Don't let a bit of ground go to waste.
Have flowers and vegetables, even if there
isn't room for more than half a dozen plants&mdash;or
only <i>one</i> plant for that matter, for that
one solitary plant will be a great deal better
than none at all.</p>

<h2 class="p4">XI</h2>

<p class="pn center mid">LEFT-OVERS</p>

<p class="pn p2">There are more ways than one to secure
fertilizers and fine soil for the small garden.
If sward is cut from the roadside,
chopped into small pieces, and stored away
in some corner of the yard that is convenient
to get at, and the soapsuds from wash-day are
poured over it each week, it will, in a short
time, if stirred frequently, become a most
excellent substitute for leaf-mold. The grassroots,
when decayed, will become a vegetable
fertilizer which will be found extremely valuable
in the culture of such plants as require
a light, rich soil, especially when small.</p>

<p class="p2">Some quite artistic effects can be secured
in the vegetable-garden by the exercise of a
little thought. The large-leaved beet has
foliage of a dark, rich crimson quite as ornamental
as that of many plants used by gardeners
to produce the "tropical effects"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
which many persons admire. When planted in
the background, with fine-foliaged plants like
carrot or parsley in front of it, the effect will
be extremely pleasing because of the contrast
of color, and also of habit. The red pepper,
planted where it can show its brilliantly
colored fruit against the green of some plant,
will give a bit of brightness that will not
fail to be appreciated by those who have a
keen eye for color-harmony. It is well to
plan for these touches of the artistic, even
in the vegetable garden.</p>

<p class="p2">Tomatoes are often grown on racks and
trellises. Where this is done there will be
no danger of the fruit's decaying, as is often
the case when the plants are given no support
and their branches come in contact
with the ground.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to scatter clean, dry
straw under the plants after they begin to
set fruit.</p>

<p class="p2">It is also a good plan to pinch off the ends
of some of the tomato-vines after the first
liberal setting of fruit. This throws the
strength of the plant into the development
of the fruit that has set, instead of into the
production of new branches which are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
needed. It also hastens the maturity of it.
If the tomato is allowed to do so it will keep
on growing and blooming and setting fruit
throughout the entire season, and as a natural
consequence much of it will be immature
when frost comes. It is well to prevent this
wasting of the plant's forces by shortening the
main branches of it in August and September.</p>

<p class="p2">In the chapter devoted to the mention of
the best varieties of vegetables to plant, I
neglected to say a good word for sage and
summer savory, both of which the housewife
will find very useful in seasoning soups,
sausage, and other articles of food. If cut
when in their prime and hung in the shade to
dry, all their flavor will be retained. When
perfectly dry, rub the leaves from the stalks,
pulverize them well, and store in paper bags
to prevent the loss of their flavor.</p>

<p class="p2">Dill and caraway seed are often used in
cookery, and, as "variety is the spice of
life," it may be well for the housewife to
grow a few plants of each. The writer has
a very vivid recollection of grandmother's
caraway cookies, and many of the present
generation declare a liking for pickles flavored
with dill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">To add to the attractive appearance of the
table in winter I would advise growing a few
plants of the red or purple cabbage to work
up in slaws and salads. Beets are capable of
giving a bit of color to the table that will be
as pleasing to the eye as the taste of this
vegetable is delightful to the palate. A root
of parsley, potted in fall, will not only afford
much material for the garnishing of the various
dishes to which the housewife likes to
add a touch of this kind, but it can be made
the basis of a really beautiful table decoration.
A few bright flowers thrust in among
its crinkly foliage will be quite as effective as
many more pretentious decorative schemes.</p>

<p class="p2">The amateur gardener may begin work
with the belief that one crop in a season is
all he can expect from his garden. He will
soon discover his mistake. The early radishes
and the first crop of lettuce will mature before
midsummer, and the ground they occupied
can be planted to later varieties from
which a fully developed second crop can be
expected. Or other vegetables, like beets
and onions, can be planted where they grew,
to furnish material for the pickling season.
After the early potatoes have been dug the
ground they occupied should not be allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to lie idle. Something can be planted there
for fall use. To make the garden the greatest
possible source of profit, not a foot of it should
be suffered to go to waste at any time during
the growing season.</p>

<p class="p2">Radishes would be well worth growing for
their beauty alone. A plate of them, nested
in their own green foliage gives the breakfast-table
a touch of bright color that adds
the charm of beauty to the food with which
it is associated. The writer believes in making
the table as attractive in appearance as
the food on it is toothsome whenever it is
possible to do so.</p>

<p class="p2">I notice that I have overlooked the pumpkin.
The oversight was unintentional, and
I beg the pardon of the vegetable without
which the housewife would be "lost" along
about Thanksgiving-time.</p>

<p>The pumpkin is out of place in the small
garden because of its rampant growth, but
a few plants of the New England Pie variety
should be grown wherever there is room for
it, to supply material for the delicious pumpkin
pies most of us enjoy so much in winter.
Well-ripened specimens keep well when stored
in cool, dry cellars, if placed on racks or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
shelves that will prevent them from coming
in contact with the cold, damp cellar-bottom.</p>

<p class="p2">If frost nips the tomato-vines before all
their fruit is fully ripened, pull them up and
hang them against a wall where the sun can
get at them. Hang blankets over them if
the nights are cold. Here they will ripen
as perfectly as on the vines in the garden,
and one can enjoy fresh fruit from them until
the coming of very cold weather.</p>

<p class="p2">Before cold weather sets in go over the
garden, be it large or small, and gather up
every bit of rubbish that can be found.
Pull up the dead plants and burn them.
Store racks and trellises under cover for use
another season. If these are properly taken
care of they will last for several years, but
if left exposed to the storms of winter they
will be short-lived.</p>

<p class="p2">Dig a quantity of parsnips and salsify to
be stored in the cellar for winter use. Cover
the strawberry-bed with leaves or straw,
spreading lightly. Coarse litter from the
barn-yard is often used for this purpose, but
it is objectionable because of its containing
so many weed-seeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Many experienced gardeners advocate
plowing or spading the garden in fall. This,
they claim, helps to kill the larvæ which insects
have deposited in the soil, and it puts
the ground in good working condition earlier
in spring. But it will have to be gone over
in spring to incorporate with it whatever fertilizer
is made use of.</p>

<p class="p2">Fresh barn-yard manure should never be
used. It ought to lie for at least a season
before applying it to the vegetable-garden.
Give it a chance to ferment and kill many of
the seeds that are in it.</p>

<p class="p2">If the soil of the garden contains considerable
clay, and is rather stiff in consequence,
the application of coarse sand, old mortar, and
coal-ashes will lighten and greatly improve it.</p>

<p class="p2">Do not allow grass or weeds to grow on any
of the unused soil in or about the garden,
for insects will congregate there and make it
the base from which to make their raids
upon the plants you set out to grow.</p>

<p class="p2">We are often advised to apply a dressing
of salt to the asparagus-bed. I have never
been able to see that the plants received any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
direct benefit from it, but if it is scattered
quite thickly over the ground it will prevent
weeds from growing, thus benefiting the
plants indirectly.</p>

<p class="p2">Asparagus is often attacked by a sporadic
growth which causes the foliage to look
rusty, hence the term, asparagus-rust. As
soon as it is discovered, cut the tops and
burn them. If allowed to remain the plants
will likely be attacked next season, as the
spores are not killed by cold.</p>

<p class="p2">If the bugs and beetles that attack young
plants of cucumber, squash, and melon do
not yield promptly to the application of
dry road-dust, fine coal-ashes, or land-plaster,
it may be well to cover frames with fine
wire netting, such as door- and window-screens
are made from, and put over the
plants. Care should be taken to see that
these frames fit the ground snugly, or have
earth banked up about them, to prevent the
enemy from crawling under. After the plants
have made their third or fourth leaves the
beetle will not be likely to injure them.</p>

<p class="p2">I am often asked why writers on gardening
matters never advise the use of home-grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
seed. One answer to this query is this:
In the ordinary garden plants stand close to
one another, and the varieties we grow are
almost sure to mix, by one variety being
pollenized by another. The seed from these
plants will seldom produce plants like either
parent variety. Sometimes they may be
equal to them in most respects, but we cannot
depend on their being so. Therefore, if
we desire to grow superior varieties that are
of pure blood, it becomes necessary for us to
procure fresh seed each season from dealers
who take pains to see that there shall be no
"mixing" among their plants.</p>

<p class="p2">Every season some enterprising seedsman
comes out with an announcement that he
has developed or discovered a remarkable
new variety of some standard vegetable so
far superior to any other variety on the market
that, as soon as its merits become fully
known, it will drive all competitors out of
the field. Of course this new candidate for
favor is offered at a fancy price, "because
the supply is limited, and the demand for it
is increasing to such an extent that the entire
stock will soon be sold out. Order at
once, to avoid disappointment." Don't be
in a hurry to take this advice. Wait until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
next season. The chances are that you will
hear nothing more about it. We have so
many very excellent varieties now that there
is no reason why we should ask for anything
better. If the "novelty" is the possessor of
real merit you will be sure to hear about it
later, but it is hardly likely to prove an improvement
on what we already have, for it
is hard to imagine anything superior to the
standard varieties of vegetables that we
have at present.</p>

<p class="p2">I would not advise purchasing seed at the
general store. Some of this may be reliable,
but so much of it is inferior that one cannot
afford to run the risk of experimenting with
it. It is the part of wisdom to purchase
where you can feel sure of getting just the
variety you want.</p>

<p class="p2">We are likely to have a few frosty nights
along about the middle of September. Tender
vegetables may be injured if not protected.
But if covered with blankets or
papers the danger may be tided over, and
during the long period of pleasant weather
that generally follows these early frosts we can
get as much pleasure out of the garden as it afforded
during the early fall. It pays to protect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The housewife will take a great deal of delight
in the preparation of piccalilli, chow-chow,
and the various other condiments
which have such a stimulating effect on the
appetite in early spring, when "that tired
feeling" is likely to make a good deal of the
food that is placed before us unattractive.
In the making of these good things unripe
tomatoes and peppers will play an important
part. So will onions that are too small to
store away for winter use. She will find use
for all of these things which a man would consider
worthless. Really, there is but little
chance for waste of garden productions if
there is an appreciative and prudent woman
in the kitchen.</p>

<p class="p2">A few roots of horseradish should find a
place in all gardens, preferably in some out-of-the-way
corner where it can be allowed
to spread without interfering with other
plants. Spread it will, every little piece of
root that is broken off in the ground in digging
the large roots becoming an independent
plant as soon as thrown upon its own resources.
Because of this tendency to "take
possession of the land" many persons who
have undertaken its culture refuse to give it
a place in their gardens. But it is really an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
easy matter to keep it within the limits assigned
it by promptly uprooting any plant
that may make its appearance outside the
space given over to it. Those who are fond
of something pungent and peppery to eat
with meats, either hot or cold, will not consent
to be without it. It is at its best as soon
as the frost is out of the ground sufficiently
to admit of its being dug. It should be used
as soon as possible after digging, as it loses
much of its piquant quality if left exposed
to the air for a short time. Roots can be
dug in late fall for winter use, and packed in
boxes of soil, which should be stored in the
cellar or some other place where they can be
kept as cool as possible without actually
freezing. But in order to have it in perfection
roots freshly dug in spring must be depended
on.</p>

<p class="p2">Leaves of horseradish make excellent greens
if used when green and tender. A few of
them cooked with young beets will give the
latter a flavor that will make their sweetness
all the more appreciable.</p>

<p class="p2">Speaking of greens reminds me to say that
the dandelion can be cultivated to advantage
in the home garden. Under cultivation it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
improves in size, and becomes a plant quite
unlike the tiny, hundred-leaved specimens
we dig from the roadside in spring, of which
a bushel will be required in order to secure a
good "mess" for a greens-loving family, as
most of such a picking will have to be discarded
when it is "looked over" preparatory
to cooking. In order to prevent the garden-grown
dandelion from becoming a nuisance it
must not be allowed to bloom and develop seed.</p>

<p class="p2">A most delightful salad can be made from
the new growth of the dandelion, in spring,
if properly bleached. This can be done by
covering the plants with dry leaves as soon
as they begin to grow, thus excluding light
and inducing rapid development. Or, if most
convenient, flower-pots can be inverted over
the plants. The small amount of light that
comes to them through the drainage-hole in
the bottom of the pot will materially assist
in hastening the growth of the leaves in such
a manner as to give them a crisp tenderness
and deprive them of that bitter tang which
characterizes the foliage when fully grown
under exposure to the light and air. Just
enough of this spicy quality to make the
salad delightfully appetizing will be found in
them when grown in this way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Mention has several times been made in
the preceding pages of Bordeaux mixture.
This is a preparation used by small-fruit
growers everywhere to combat diseases of a
fungous character which prevail to an alarming
extent in almost all sections of the country
in early spring. It is a standard remedy
for many of the ills that this class of plants
is heir to, and no up-to-date orchardist would
think for a moment of neglecting its use if
he would grow a fine crop of apples. It has
not heretofore come into common use among
those who grow small fruit on a small scale,
because it is rather difficult to prepare it
properly, but now a preparation of it that is
ready for use by simply mixing it with water
can be obtained from all seedsmen. The use
of it in spring when fruit is setting, to prevent
injury from the curculio and other enemies
of small fruits, is to be encouraged.</p>

<p class="p2">Every gardener should be provided with
pruning-shears with which to prune whatever
plants he or she may grow that require frequent
attention of that kind. A jack-knife
answers the purpose very well in the hands
of a man, but up to the present time no
woman is known to have made a success of
its use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Currant-bushes grow readily from cuttings.
Insert a piece of half-ripened wood five or
six inches long into the ground and it will
almost invariably take root. In order to
keep this plant in healthy bearing condition
it should be pruned rather severely each
season. Cut away all weak wood, and encourage
the production of strong new shoots,
from which fruit will be borne next season.
Remove a good share of the old branches
after they have ripened the present season's
crop. If this is not done the bush will after
a little become crowded with branches, and
as all branches, old and new, will attempt to
bear, you will be pretty sure to have a production
of very inferior fruit, since it will be
impossible for the bush to perfect all the
berries that set and have them come up to
the standard of superiority that should govern
the grower. Small currants are good, as
far as they go, but the trouble is&mdash;they don't
go far enough. Many of them will have to
be discarded when the housewife makes her
selection.</p>

<p class="p2">If the amateur gardener desires to give
some of his vegetables an early start, I would
advise him to try what may be called the
"sod-method" in preference to any other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Sod is cut from roadside or pasture in fall
and stacked up in the cellar for use in early
spring. When seed is to be sown, invert the
piece of sod, and scatter the seed over the
surface, which, it will be understood, was
<i>not</i> the surface originally. In other words,
what <i>was</i> the surface is now the bottom of
the piece which receives the seed. When it
comes time to put the seedlings out of doors
the sod can be cut apart in such a manner
that each has its bit of soil, and this can be
transferred to the garden without interfering
in any way with the roots of the young plant.</p>

<p class="p2">While barn-yard manure&mdash;especially that
which contains a good deal of cow manure&mdash;is
one of the very best of all fertilizers, it
is not always obtainable, and this makes it
necessary to resort to some kind of commercial
fertilizer. If one is not familiar with
any of these fertilizers he ought not to select
at random, as he may get a kind not at all
adapted to his requirements. I would advise
finding some one who understands the
peculiarity of the soil in his locality, and
who has had some experience in the use of
commercial fertilizers, and being governed
by his advice. Experimental knowledge is
often expensive, and the use of a fertilizer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
that is not adapted to the soil in one's garden
often ruins a season's crops.</p>

<p class="p2">The ideal support for pea-vines is brush,
but not every gardener is able to obtain
it. Some persons substitute binder-twine
stretched from stake to stake. This answers
very well as long as the weather remains
dry, but as soon as a rain-storm comes along
the twine absorbs so much moisture that it
relaxes its tension and sags in such a manner
as to endanger the vines which have
taken hold of it. Coarse-meshed wire netting
will be found much more satisfactory, as it
will not sag and cannot be blown down by
winds. Care must be taken to see that it <i>is</i>
coarse-meshed, as the fine-meshed sorts will
not admit of the vine's working its way out
and in among the meshes. If a supply of
brush can be obtained, use it by all means,
and at the end of the pea-season pull it up
and store it away in a dry place. If this is
done, it can be made to do duty for several
seasons. If netting is used, do not allow it
to remain out of doors in winter. By untacking
it from the stakes which are set for
its support, and rolling it up carefully, and
storing it away from the storms of winter,
it can be made to last a lifetime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Don't depend upon home-grown seed.
Some of it may be just as good as that
which can be bought from reliable seedsmen,
but the probabilities are that it is
not, because of the tendencies of most
plants to "mix." Plants grown from seed
saved from the home garden often&mdash;and generally&mdash;show
some of the characteristics of
several varieties of the same family, and
frequently these characteristics are not the
ones we would like to perpetuate. Seedlings
from varieties pollenized by other varieties
show a decided inclination to revert to original
types, and these are in most instances
the very characteristics we would like to get
away from. It is always advisable to procure
fresh seed each season, and to procure it
from men who make seed-growing a specialty.</p>

<p class="p2">The housewife who likes to make her table
and the food she places upon it as attractive
as possible, will do well to pot a few plants
of parsley in early fall. Choose for this
purpose the smaller plants. Three or four
can be put into one pot if the latter is of good
size. These can be kept in the kitchen
window, where they will be quite as ornamental
as most house plants, or they can be
kept in the cellar window if frost is prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
from getting to them. From them one can
always obtain material for the decoration of
roasts and other dishes which require garnishment.</p>

<p class="p2">Squashes and pumpkins will not keep well
if stored in very warm places. A room that
is just a little above the frost-point is the
best place for them. It will be found far
superior to a cellar, as the latter is generally
more or less damp, and dampness is one of the
worst enemies of these vegetables. A cool,
dry atmosphere is what they need, and if it
can be given them they can be kept in fine
condition throughout the entire winter. Care
should be taken, in gathering them, to not
break their stems. If this is done they frequently
decay at the place where stem and
vegetable unite, and this condition spreads
rapidly to all portions of them.</p>


<p class="p2">The question is frequently asked:</p>

<p>Would you advise plowing or spading the
garden in fall? If it could have but one season's
attention, I would advise giving it in
spring. But if the owner of a garden has ample
time to devote to it, I would advise plowing
or spading in both seasons. Turning up
the soil in fall exposes to the elements that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
portion of it which is most likely to contain
worms and insects which have burrowed
away for the winter, and it is desirable to
make way with as many of these as possible.
Stirring the soil in spring will do them very
little harm, as the weather will be in their
favor. Fall stirring of the soil is also conducive
to a greater degree of mellowness than
is likely to result from one operation, and that
in spring, as the clods of earth that are thrown
up disintegrate under the influence of frost
and will be in a condition to pulverize easily
when spring comes.</p>

<p class="p2">The average gardener doesn't seem to associate
the growing of vegetables with an
idea of beauty, but he will find, if he looks
into the matter, that the vegetable-garden
can be made really ornamental. A row of
carrots with its feathery green foliage is
quite as attractive as many of our decorative
plants; and beets, with crimson foliage,
are really tropical in their rich coloring.
Parsley and lettuce make excellent and ornamental
edgings for beds containing other
vegetables. Tomatoes, trained to upright
trellises, are quite as showy as many kinds
of flowers, when their fruit begins to ripen.
Peppers work in charmingly with the colorscheme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of the vegetable-garden. A little
study of garden possibilities will soon convince
one that it is an easy matter to make
the vegetable-garden as attractive, so far as
color is concerned, as the flower-garden is.
And while we are at work at gardening, why
not make it as attractive as possible? The
pleasing appearance of it will lend additional
qualities to the fine flavor of its
vegetables if we believe that beauty and
practicality ought to work in harmony with
each other.</p>

<p class="p2">Sage, summer savory, and other garden-grown
plants used for seasoning or medicinal
purposes should be gathered when in their
prime. If one waits until late in the season
before cutting them, much of their virtue will
have been expended in the ripening process
which all plants undergo after they complete
their growth. Cut them close to the ground,
and tie them in loose bunches, and hang them
in a shady place until their moisture has
evaporated. Then put them in paper bags
and hang away in a store-room or closet for
the winter. Plants treated in this way will
retain nearly all their original flavor, and be
found far superior to the kinds you buy at
the store.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Cucumbers that have grown to full size
should be gathered if not wanted for use, as
to allow them to remain on the vines after
reaching maturity, and while ripening, materially
affects the productiveness of the plants.</p>

<p class="p2">Endive is the basis of one of our best and
most wholesome fall and winter salads. When
nearly full-grown it must be bleached, like
celery. Gather the leaves together and tie
them in such a manner as to exclude the
light. Do this when they are perfectly dry.
If wet or damp they are likely to rot.</p>

<p class="p2">Some gardeners use what is called onion
"sets" instead of seed. These "sets" are
the result of sowing seed very thickly in
spring the season before they are wanted
for planting. As soon as their tops die off
in summer&mdash;as they will if seed was sown
thickly enough&mdash;store in a dry and airy
place, and the following spring replant. By
this method large onions are obtained very
early in the season. Most market-gardeners
depend on "sets" instead of seed.</p>

<p class="p2">Mention has been made of a few of our
pot and medicinal plants. Here is a larger
list for those who are interested in plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of this kind: balm, sweet basil, caraway,
catnip, camomile, coriander, dill, pennyroyal,
peppermint, saffron, tansy, and
wormwood. Our grandmothers had unlimited
faith in the medicinal qualities of
some of these plants, and many a mother will
be glad to know that she has a stock of some
of them stored away for winter use when colds
and coughs are prevalent among children or
grown people. Some of the old home remedies
are far preferable to those we are accustomed
to using, as they are harmless, if
they do no good, which is something that
cannot be said of most drugs that are taken
into the system.</p>


<p class="p2">Don't wait for the currant-worm to show
itself on your bushes. You can safely count
on its coming. Act on the defensive in advance
by spraying your plants thoroughly
with an infusion of Nicoticide, keeping in
mind the fact that it is easier to prevent an
insect from establishing itself on your plants
than it is to get rid of it when it has secured
a foothold there. In spraying, be sure that
the infusion gets to all parts of the bush.
Throw it up well among the branches. Simply
spraying it over the plant isn't what is
needed. It must reach the under side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
foliage, and all parts where insects and other
enemies might hide away and escape contact
with the infusion used.</p>

<p class="p2">When the small-fruit plants in your garden
show evidence of having outlived their usefulness,
don't try to renew them, but dig
them up and plant new ones. You cannot
make a satisfactory plant out of one that
has begun to show age. It is a good plan to
set a few new plants each season. If this is
done there need be no gap in the fruit-supply,
as there will always be some coming on to
take the places of those whose days of usefulness
are over. Too often we neglect our
gardens until they are in such a debilitated
condition that we get but slight returns
from them, and then we set to work to
make them all over, and in this way we
fail to get as much out of them as we ought
to. By planting something each season we
keep them up to bearing-point, and have no
"off seasons."</p>

<p class="p2">I wonder how many housewives who may
read this little book have ever dried sweet-corn
for winter use. Not many, I think.
But if they were to do so one season I am
quite confident that thereafter they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
not willingly be without a generous supply
of it, for it will be found far more delicious
than the ordinary canned article. In drying
it, some cook it for a few minutes, and then
cut it from the cob and spread it out on
plates to dry. Others do not think it worth
while to cook it, but cut it from the cob as
soon as gathered, and dry it by first putting
it in the oven for a few minutes before exposing
it to the sun to dry. The little time
in the oven is equivalent to the partial cooking
spoken of. Turn it on the plates on which
it is spread every day, and do not consider
it dry enough to store away until it appears
to have parted with all its moisture. Then
put it into paper bags or glass jars, and set
away in a cool, dark place to remain until
you desire to use it. Soak it for two or three
hours before putting it on the stove to cook.
When properly cooked it will be tender and
have a more delicious flavor than canned
corn. The generous use of butter and cream
will make it a dish that is fit to set before a
king.</p>

<p class="p2">Those who happen to live in places where
it is not possible to have cellars, because of
low ground, can have places in which to
store vegetables for winter use that are really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
preferable to the ordinary cellar, by constructing
what might be called above-ground
pits, for want of a better name. Build up a
wall four or five feet high, and bank up about
it with so much earth that frost cannot penetrate
it. Cover with a roof that will keep out
cold and rain. Have a doorway opening into
it from an entry built after the fashion of the
little storm-vestibules we put over the front
doors of our dwellings in winter. In other
words, an entry into which we can step and
close one door behind us before we open the
one that lets us into the place where our
vegetables are. Such a room can be constructed
with but little expense. Because of
its being above ground it will be drier than
a cellar, and in the majority of cases it will
be more convenient to get at. It should be
boarded up with a good quality of matched
boarding, and its walls should be lined with
two or three thicknesses of sheathing paper
put on in such a manner as to show no cracks
or openings.</p>

<p class="p2">The best place for a vegetable-garden is
where the soil is naturally well drained and
where there is a slope to the south. Such a
slope enables it to get the full benefit of sunshine,
and sunshine, it will be found, is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
important factor in successful gardening. If
such an exposure is out of the question, aim
to make conditions as favorable as possible.
A closely boarded fence on the north side of
a garden affords excellent protection from
cold winds early in the season, and helps
greatly in keeping away frost in fall, when
many plants are maturing.</p>

<p>Mention is made in the above paragraph
of good drainage. This is quite important.
If the soil of a garden is <i>not</i> well drained,
many kinds of vegetables cannot be grown
in it, and few will attain to even a partial
degree of success. Therefore see to it that
by ditching, or the use of tile, all surplus
water is properly disposed of. Much good
can be done to a heavy soil by adding to it
sharp, coarse sand, old mortar&mdash;anything
that will have a tendency to counteract the
heaviness resulting from undue retention of
water or a naturally too close character of
soil. If sand is obtainable, and your garden
is one in which clay predominates, use it in
generous quantities. You will find it as
beneficial as manure. Spread it over the
surface before plowing or spading, and work
it in thoroughly. A few seasons' application
will bring about a very marked change for
the better in any garden whose soil cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
be made fine and mellow without the addition
of some disintegrating matter. Good
drainage must be secured in order to grow
good vegetables, and the use of tile will be
found a most effective remedy for the evil
of a soil unduly retentive of moisture.</p>

<p class="p2">In almost all localities there will be families
who have no garden, but who would make
liberal use of vegetables if they were easily
procurable. There is a chance for boys and
girls to earn an "honest penny." If it is
found that there is likely to be more in the
home garden than the family can make use of,
canvass the neighborhood for customers for
the probable surplus. It will be found an
easy matter to dispose of it. I know several
amateur child gardeners who secure enough
in this way to pay for all the seed they need.
Some of them have regular customers each
season, and gardening begins to look to them
like a profitable occupation. I don't know
that they will become professional gardeners,
but they will be learning something as well
as earning something while they are fitting
themselves for whatever occupation in life
they may decide on, and what they learn in
the garden will be of benefit in after-life in
more ways than one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Don't neglect to save everything that can
be made use of for fertilizing purposes. In
many a home the "suds" of washing-day
are disposed of as worthless. If applied to
growing things in the garden they will often
prove as beneficial as the application of a
fertilizer that costs quite a little sum of
money. Especially is this the case if the season
happens to be a dry one. If there does
not seem to be a need of more moisture in
the soil on wash-day, save the soapy water
against a time of need. It will be sure to
"come handy" during the season.</p>

<p>Some families are so unfortunate as to
have no cellar. Few vegetables can be kept
well, or for a great length of time, in ordinary
rooms, unless something is done to modify
the conditions usually existing there. If a
large box is filled with dry sand, potatoes,
parsnips, salsify, beets, and carrots can be
buried in it and made to retain their freshness
for an indefinite period. Of course this
storage-box should be kept as far as possible
from artificial heat, and no dampness should
be allowed to come in contact with it, as
sand absorbs moisture almost as readily as
a sponge, and the satisfactory keeping of the
vegetables named depends upon dryness more
than anything else. The lower the temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of the place in which vegetables are
stored the better, provided it never gets below
the freezing-point. Where boxes of sand
are used, slight freezings are not likely to
seriously injure vegetables, as the sand extracts
the frost so gradually that but little
harm is done. But hard freezing must be
guarded against or premature decay will result.</p>

<p>It is an excellent plan to bury some of
the vegetables named above in a dry place
in the garden, for use in spring. They will
be found as fresh and crisp as when put into
the ground, if covered deep enough to protect
them from frost.</p>

<p class="pn center mid">HEALTH IN THE GARDEN. A CHAPTER EXPRESSLY
FOR WOMEN READERS</p>

<p class="pn p2">The writer of this book often finds women
who seem "all run down," without being
able to tell of any positive physical ailment.
Inquiry generally develops the fact that they
have overworked; that they have been confined
to the house the greater part of the
time, busy with household matters, and that
in caring for others they have neglected to
care for themselves. Though I am not an
M.D. I take the liberty of prescribing for
patients of this class. My prescription is a
course of treatment in the garden. I insist
on their getting out of doors, where the air
is pure, and the sunshine bright and warm,
and Nature is waiting to give her pleasant
companionship to whoever signifies a desire
to make her acquaintance.</p>

<p>There is health in the garden. But because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
one has to dig for it some persons prefer
to keep on enjoying their old miserableness
day after day and year after year. These
are the incurables&mdash;the "chronic" cases
that one cannot expect to do much with or
for. But those who are willing to exert
themselves in an effort to get back the
tone that life has lost to a considerable
extent will find that work in the garden is
a better tonic than our doctors have a
record of in their pharmacop&oelig;ia.</p>

<p>The earth fairly tingles with life in spring,
and by putting ourselves in contact with it
we absorb some of this vitality. We breathe
in the wine of a <i>new</i> life, and we thrill with a
thousand sensations that can come only from
putting ourselves in close touch with Nature.
You can tell a woman who needs a change
from indoors to outdoors that she ought to
take more exercise, but if you advise walking
the chances are that she won't walk much.
That kind of exercise doesn't appeal to her,
and to make whatever kind of exercise she
takes effective it must be something that
affords her pleasure&mdash;something that she enjoys
more than she does doing things from
a "<i>sense of duty</i>," or simply because she has
been <i>told</i> to do it. What is needed is some
form of exercise that has <i>an object in it</i>&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
definite object, rather than the more or less
abstract one of "regaining health."</p>

<p>Give her a few packages of seeds and arouse
in her the enthusiasm to have a garden and
she will get the very best kind of exercise out
of her attempt to carry out the plan, and the
"definite object"&mdash;in other words, the garden&mdash;that
she has in mind will keep her so delightfully
busy that she will forget all about
the health-features of the undertaking until
it dawns upon her with startling suddenness
some fine day that she "has got her health
back." How or when it came she cannot tell
you. All she knows is that she feels like a
new woman. After that there will be no
necessity to repeat the prescription, for one
year's half-way successful work in the garden
fixes "the garden habit" for all time.
Nothing else can afford so much pleasure and
exercise in happy combination as gardening,
or exert a greater fascination over the person
who allows herself to come under its influence.</p>

<p>I cannot begin to tell you what wonderful
and delightful things I have learned in the
garden. It is like having the Book of Nature
opened before you and being taught its lore
by the book's own author. You see magical
things taking place about you every day, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
every day there are more of them, to set you
thinking and wondering. You may work
until you are tired, but you do not realize
physical wear and tear because your mind has
something else that it considers of greater
importance to busy itself over. Only after
the work of the day is done will you become
conscious of physical weariness, and then it
is that you find out what the luxury of rest
is; to fully appreciate rest we must first
understand what it is to be really tired.</p>

<p>Lassitude, ennui&mdash;these do not give us a
knowledge of genuine tiredness, therefore we
are not in a condition to receive the full benefit
of that rest which means a reaction of the
physical system until we have done some
kind of work that makes reaction necessary
in order to establish a normal equilibrium.
The rest that comes after getting really tired
is so full of delightful sensations that we admit
to ourselves that it is richly worth the
price we have to pay for it.</p>

<p>There is a subtle charm about garden work
from its very beginning. The seed we sow has
a mystery wrapped up in it. The processes
of germination are as fascinating as a fairytale.
The development of the tiny seedling
is a source of constant wonder to us. We
watch for the first bud with eager impatience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and it has to be on the alert if it succeeds in
opening without our being on hand to observe
the performance. Spring begins the
story, summer carries it forward, and autumn
seems to complete it, but there is always the
promise of the retelling of the story another
year to keep us interested from the end of
one season to the coming of another. Garden
work is a sort of thousand and one days' entertainment,
in which the interest is continually
kept up&mdash;always something to look forward
to&mdash;always something new.</p>

<p>The woman who grows weary over the
monotony of household duties, but cannot
put them entirely aside, will find relaxation
in the garden. The change will rest her.
And the woman who has no household duties
to claim her attention needs something to
get interested in. Both will find the necessary
stimulus in growing flowers.</p>

<p>But in order to do this it must not be
"played at." Set about it because you mean
to accomplish something. A week after you
have begun in earnest you will find yourself
looking forward impatiently to the hour that
takes you out of doors. You will forget about
the gloves that you probably provided yourself
with at the outset. You won't be bothered
with veils. Tan will have no terrors for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
you. You will look upon dirt as something
pleasing because you begin to see the possibilities
in it. You will go back to the house
with an appetite that makes plain bread and
butter delicious.</p>

<p>Have a garden.</p>

<p>And do all the work in it yourself.</p>

<p>That's the secret of the benefit you are to
get out of it.</p>
